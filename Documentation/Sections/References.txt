	abstract = {In this paper, I will introduce to the {APSIPA} audience an emerging area of machine learning, deep-structured learning. It refers to a class of machine learning techniques, developed mostly since 2006, where many layers of information processing stages in hierarchical architectures are exploited for pattern classification and for unsupervised feature learning. First, the brief history of deep learning is discussed. Then, I develop a classificatory scheme to analyze and summarize major work reported in the deep learning literature. Using this scheme, I provide a taxonomy-oriented survey on the existing deep architectures, and categorize them into three types: generative, discriminative, and hybrid. Two prime deep architectures, one hybrid and one discriminative, are presented in detail. Finally, selected applications of deep learning are reviewed in broad areas of information processing including audio/speech, image/video, multimodality, language modeling, natural language processing, and information retrieval.},

	abstract = {The effective farming means lossless farming which is a desired need of current scenario, since the cost of farming is increasing continuously. Weeds are a big problem in agriculture because it is major part of agricultural losses. Nowadays, herbicides are sprayed uniformly throughout the field to control the weed. This method is not only expensive but also have bad impacts on environment and human health. Therefore, an automatic system is needed for spot spray. Improvement in drone technology leads to availability of high payload drone that are suitable for pesticides spraying. Embedded system programed with deep learning when use to control the drone then it will be possible to spray the herbicides at desired place. This paper discusses the artificial intelligence ({AI}) based crop monitoring and weed detection system that are suitable for spot herbicides spraying.},
